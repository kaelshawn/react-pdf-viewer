## v4.0.0 [WIP]

**New feature**

It's possible to use the legacy build of pdf-js by using the new worker. It can be used in environments that don't support modern JavaScript features.

```tsx
import { LegacyWorker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/legacy-worker';

<LegacyWorker workerUrl={...}>
    <Viewer ... />
</LegacyWorker>
```

**Breaking change**

The `Worker` is moved to `@react-pdf-viewer/worker`:

_Install_

```shell
$ npm install --save-dev @react-pdf-viewer/worker
```

_Use the worker_

```tsx
// Before v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/core';

// v4.0.0
import { Worker } from '@react-pdf-viewer/worker';
```

**Bug fix**

-   Render the initial page without loading the document completely
